            <h1>HISTORY</h1>
            <p>
                The Secret Village is a brand name of the BIZ Reguliersdwarsstraat, where BIZ stands for Business
                Investment Zone. This is a new legal structure where all businesses on the street are compulsory members
                and therefore all contribute to the activities of the BIZ. This is to prevent individuals from
                benefiting from improvements without sharing the costs. </p>

            <h1>SUSTAINABILLITY</h1>
            <p>
                In close collaboration with the district and municipal authorities, efforts were directed not only
                towards
                maintaining a "clean, intact, and safe" environment but also towards significant greening initiatives.
                Starting in late 2015, vertical greenery and the installation of sidewalk gardens began in the
                Reguliersdwarsstraat and its three adjoining alleys.
