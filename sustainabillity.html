            <h1>Making it green</h1>
            <p>
                In close collaboration with the district and municipal authorities, efforts were directed not only
                towards
                maintaining a "clean, intact, and safe" environment but also towards significant greening initiatives.
                Starting in late 2015, vertical greenery and the installation of sidewalk gardens began in the
                Reguliersdwarsstraat and its three adjoining alleys.
                <br><br>
                Just in time for the official launch of the Secret Village, a series of large wisteria plants,
                cultivated in
                Italy, were installed along the facades of the Reguliersdwarsstraat, Sint Jorisstraat, and
                Geelvinckssteeg.
                While these installations now boast lush greenery, the anticipated profuse blooming has yet to
                materialize.
                <br><br>
                Tawab, a former Afghan refugee who began working as a dishwasher at the Garlic Queen restaurant in 2017,
                has
                since become a familiar face in the area. In the summer of 2022, a crowdfunding campaign was swiftly
                organized to prevent Tawab from becoming homeless.
                <br><br>
                Recognized as one of the winners in the "Most Beautiful Green Facades of Amsterdam" competition in
                December
                2018, the greening project of the Secret Village was lauded by the jury for its exemplary collaboration
                between residents and entrepreneurs, resulting in a stunningly verdant street.

            <h1>Making it sustainable</h1>
            <p>After the greening efforts, initiatives for sustainability were also pursued in the street. This included
                arranging for a single communal waste collector, aiming for energy-efficient lighting, collecting coffee
                grounds to grow oyster mushrooms, and using cups made from corn or seaweed during events.
                <br><br>
                The greening and improvements in logistics and sustainability also became the objectives of a 2-year
                project, serving as a showcase for greening entire cities. To implement this, Tanja van der Knoop
                founded the Green City Buzz foundation in January 2017.
                <br><br>
                However, the collaboration between the BIZ Reguliersdwarsstraat and Green City Buzz ended in the spring
                of 2018. This marked the end of most sustainability plans as many businesses viewed them as financially
                unfeasible costs.
                <br><br>
                Following the greening of the Secret Village, over 700 plants were also installed in December 2017 on
                the east side of the street, as well as in the Korte Reguliersdwarsstraat and the Schapensteeg. These
                comprised only of facade gardens and climbing plants; large wisteria plants and individual planters were
                financed by the BIZ in the Secret Village.
